								<h4>Project-1</h4>
								<p>• Led a high-performing team of 6 developers to design and develop a robust dashboard for a top-tier insurance company, leveraging Angular, JAVA, PostgreSQL, and Spring Boot technologies. 
									Successfully integrated the dashboard with multiple third-party APIs, enabling agents to easily view and sign policy documents on behalf of customers.</p>
									<p>•As a result of our efforts, the dashboard reduced the average processing time for policy documents by 50% and increased customer satisfaction by 25%.
										Additionally, I proactively managed the release process, ensuring on-time delivery of the project by overseeing review checklists, scheduling dependencies, and monitoring alert systems.
										</p>
								<h4>Project-2</h4>
										<p>•Developed a cutting-edge membership platform that transformed customer engagement and satisfaction, leveraging Angular for the frontend and Java/Spring Boot MVC for creating REST APIs on the backend. 
											The platform incorporated a seamless "Join Membership" feature and a "Monthly Payment Plan" option, which boosted customer retention by 30% and increased revenue by 10%.</p>
								<p>•To enhance security and reliability, the platform integrated secure payment processing via Stripe, ensuring PCI compliance and protecting customer data.
									Additionally, I implemented automatic renewal discounts, which increased customer loyalty by 15% and reduced churn by 10%.</p>
								<p>•The platform was built on a MySQL database, enabling fast and efficient data storage and retrieval.
									Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, including designers, product managers, and QA testers, to ensure timely delivery and high-quality execution.</p>
							<h4>Project-3</h4>
										<p>•Designed and developed a highly scalable and secure Banking Account Management system using Java, JavaScript, and MySQL. 
										The system streamlined transactions, loans, and bill payments for 50,000+ customers, resulting in a 20% increase in customer satisfaction and a 15% reduction in operational costs.</p>
								<p>•To ensure secure payment processing, the system integrated with multiple third-party services, Stripe, while adhering to strict PCI compliance standards. 
								Additionally, the system integrated Apache Kafka, a powerful real-time data streaming platform, for efficient event-driven processing, enabling responsive and scalable communication between services.</p>
								<p>•I followed a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach throughout the development process, utilizing JUnit for unit testing and Log4j for logging, resulting in a robust and reliable system.
								Working in close collaboration with cross-functional teams, including business analysts and QA testers, I successfully delivered the project on time and within budget.</p>
